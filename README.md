# FitBit Model with Arduino

Final project for CSE132 where we modeled a FitBit using an Arduino. The dynamic graph is unique to my project. The graph was displayed using the StdDraw class.

### Features: 
- Measures temperature using TMP35
- Detects steps with simple peak detection using an accelerometer
- Measures "restful sleep" which is sleep when the user isn't moving with an accelerometer
- Can change between step counter mode or sleep counter mode using a button
- Reset counters for both with a button
- Dynamic graph displays the above information


### Note: 
- The chart class displays bad coding practice as certain aspects were coded through trial-and-error
